Write a GoLang distributed application that implements the CHORD protocol/distributed hash table. Assume a CHORD ring of order 2^N for some large constant N, e.g. N=32. 
Chord nodes are assigned randomly unique 32-bit (unsigned integer) identifiers. Each Chord node maintains a bucket (list of) (key, value) pairs of a hash table that is distributed among the nodes that are members of the Chord ring. There is no limit on a node's bucket size besides the available memory to GoLang processes, while the keys and values are assumed to be strings. For convenience, Chord nodes are to be implemented as goroutines in the GoLang. Chord nodes are to communicate asynchronously with other Chord nodes using JSON messages over zeroMQ sockets. The IP address and port number of a node's socket is its access point (address). 
Your main GoLang routine (aka coordinator) should spawn some Chord nodes, and then, instruct them to join/leave the Chord ring, as well as get/put/remove key-value pairs from/to the distributed hash table. You may issue such instructions at random or read/load them from a file. 
Chord nodes reveive JSON request messages from the coordinator or other Chord nodes and respond to the sender (or reply-to address specified) directly. We assume the time it takes a node to respond to any message is a random variable (with exponential distribution whose mean is a parameter in your program). The JSON request messages among the Chord nodes and the coordinator are as follows:

{"do": "join-ring", "sponsoring-node": address } instructing the receipient node to join the Chord ring by contacting the (existing) Chord sponsoring node with the given address.
{"do": "leave-ring" "mode": "immediate or orderly"} instructing the receipient node to leave the ring immediately (without informing any other nodes) or in an orderly manner (by informing other nodes and transferring its bucket contents to others)
{"do": "stabilize-ring" }
{"do": "init-ring-fingers" }
{"do": "fix-ring-fingers" }
{"do": "ring-notify", "reply-to": address }
{"do": "get-ring-fingers", "reply-to": address }
{"do": "find-ring-successor", "reply-to": address}
{"do": "find-ring-predecessor", "reply-to": address}
{"do": "put", "data": { "key" : "a key", "value" : "a value" }, "reply-to": address} instructing the receipient node to store the given (key,value) pair in the appropriate ring node.
{"do": "get", "data": { "key" : "a key" }, "reply-to": address} instructing the receipient node to retrieve the value associated with the key stored in the ring.
{"do": "remove", "data": { "key" : "a key" }, "reply-to": address} instructing the receipient node to remove the (key,value) pair from the ring.
{"do": "list-items", "reply-to": address} instructing the receipient node to respond with a list of the key-value pairs stored at its bucket.
For convenience, to facilitate communication among the Chord nodes and the coordinator in your application, you may maintain a global dictionary of node identifiers and their addresses in a file. This is clearly unnessary in an actual distributed deployment.
